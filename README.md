# keylogger

I wrote some Python code that would execute on the command prompt and transmit the important logging data to the email address I choose.
Essentially, we will learn the reason behind another user's utilization of our system.

            SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE USING KEYLOGGER 
Introduction: The most crucial element in many businesses these days is data security and data recovery. Thus, the need for data recovery arises frequently. 
Keylogger, often known as keyboard capture or keylogging, is one of the finest solutions for these kinds of issues. Keyboard capture is the process of secretly 
recording a keystroke on a keyboard so that the user is not aware that their activity is being watched. Users can recover data from working files that have 
been damaged for a variety of circumstances, including as power outages, by using keylogger applications. This is a monitoring program that records keystrokes 
and accesses log files to obtain data about the user. With the help of this program, we can remember lost emails or URLs. Every time a user types on the keyboard 
in this keylogger project, the keystrokes are recorded and sent, secretly, to the admin's email address within the predetermined time frame. GOAL: This application's 
goal is to log every key pressed on the keyboard and forward it to the administrator via email server within the predetermined window of time. It offers data 
recovery and secrecy to any IT systems that require it.
